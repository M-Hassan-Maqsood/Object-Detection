# Human Detection using YOLOv8
This repository contains a trained YOLOv8 model for human detection. YOLOv8 is an advanced real-time object detection model that belongs to the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models. It is designed for efficient and accurate object detection in images and videos. YOLOv8 builds upon the success of its predecessors, incorporating improvements in accuracy and speed. You can use this model to detect humans in images, webcam feeds, or videos.

# Installation

I am using Google Colab to train this model because it provides my high processing power and GPU. And second benefit of this is it provides all libraries. To use the model, you'll need to install the Ultralytics library.

# Human Detection

To detect humans in images or label new images, code is in human_detection_model.ipynb file and it provides labels of these images

# Webcam

If you want to use the model with your live webcam, check out live_webcam.ipynb file.

# Video

To detect humans in videos, see video_detection.ipynb file. you give it a video as input and it provides a labeled video as output
# Demo

You can watch a demo of the human detection model in action video.mp4
# Dataset

To get dataset go to the google drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IxIeKilViI_Wv6iql6cn953_aYFfMIgG?usp=sharing)
